# rPlaylist
This app helps in resetting your playlist when you move your music files to a different destination by tracking the location and changing the path on .xspf file. The directory that is one above all the song files in the playlist. All the files in that directory and sub-directories below will be scaned to match the name of file with that in .xspf file. If multiple files are present with the same name, the one larger in size will be used.
